<p>Scientists have come up with over a hundred different definitions of the term "life". Many definitions are similar. They usually belong to one of five categories.  <sup id="cite_ref-:Pop_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:Pop-1">[1]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Definitions should help to avoid misunderstandings when working together. Scientists have therefore developed quality criteria for definitions. 
</p><p>With enumerations, a problem arises with classification if not all criteria are met. Enumerated definitions are of low quality.
</p><p>The definition is limited. It relates to earthly life. 
</p><p>Some scientists suspect that there are life forms in space that use other substances.
</p><p>The definition is wide. It does not separate biology from technology. <br>
</p><p>This definition applies to other aspects of life: Living beings try to maintain order so they don't die. 
</p><p>That's true, but definitions are meant to be intuitive. <br> 
</p><p>The definitions listed distinguish between animate and inanimate. 
</p><p>In the following symbiosis-based definition, there is a graded transition. Organisms are a higher life form than unicellular organisms because they rely on more symbioses.
</p><p><br>
</p><p>Principle-based definitions are of higher quality than adhock definitions. 
</p><p>This is a principle-based definition: symbioses form the basis of life. But biologists have different opinions on this question. 
</p><p>The symbiosis definition gives life an (ethical) value, which is important for doctors and lawyers. But many biologists strictly reject the use of philosophical terms like "love". <br>
</p><p>Life is diverse. Each of these definitions illuminates different aspects of life.
