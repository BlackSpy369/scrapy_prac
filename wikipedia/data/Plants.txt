<p>Plants are made of many <a href="/wiki/Wikijunior:Biology/Cells" title="Wikijunior:Biology/Cells">cells</a>.  Plants are usually green.  Plants make their food from the sun.  They use the light, carbon dioxide, and water to make glucose (sugar).  Animals, fungi, some bacteria, and some protists eat plants for food.

Plants make <i>oxygen</i> which humans breathe, and they take in <i>carbon-dioxide</i> which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).  Plants make their food from the sun by <i>photosynthesis</i>.  They also provide shade.  We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants.  Most foods that we eat are plants.  Without plants, animals could not survive.
</p><p>Photosynthesis is making sugar using the energy of light.
</p><p>Plants are green because they have green Chloroplasts. 
</p><p>But why are Chloroplasts green?
Chloroplasts are green because they contain the green pigment <i>chlorophyll</i> in their thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs red and blue light.
