<p><b>Biology</b> is the study of life. It helps us understand many things, such as how our body works, how our body keeps warm, and what we are made of. Biology is very important to know. Some things we can learn about in biology are <i>genetics</i> (the study of human traits), <i>zoology</i> (the study of animals), <i>botany</i> (the study of plants), and <i>ecology</i> (the study of relationships between all living things).
</p><p>Someone who studies biology is called a <i>biologist</i>.
</p><p>Living things are different from things that are not alive.  It is usually easy to tell what is living and what is not, but it is sometimes hard to tell, like with very small organisms.
</p><p>Here are some properties of living things. You might notice that some non-living things can also have some of these properties.
</p><p>Animals, bacteria, and plants are examples of living things.  Rivers, mountains, oceans, and soil are examples of non-living things, but they are often homes for living things.
</p><p>Cars and tables are also not living things, because they cannot reproduce themselves.
</p><p>Living things can be of many different sizes. Size is very important in biology, since biologists organize the structures and groupings of living creatures according to size. A living creature is called an organism. Organisms can consist of single cells or multiple different types of cells grouped into tissues and organs.
</p><p>From smallest to largest, these are how living things are grouped:
</p><p>Everything in this list is made up of the things above it. For example, communities are made of many populations and populations are made up of many organisms.
