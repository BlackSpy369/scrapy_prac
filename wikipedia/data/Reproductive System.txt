<p>In humans and many other living things, there are two sexes: <i>men</i> and <i>women</i>. Babies are made when a <a href="/wiki/Wikijunior:Biology/Cells" title="Wikijunior:Biology/Cells">cell</a> called a <i>sperm</i> (produced by men) comes together with an <i>egg cell</i> or <i>ovum</i> (produced by women) in a process called <b>fertilization</b>. When the cells combine, they form a new cell, called a <b>zygote</b> (<i>zy</i> rhymes with <i>eye</i>; <i>gote</i> sounds like <i>goat</i>) which has all it needs to make a new man or woman. The zygote will make a baby like his mother and father.
</p><p>Babies come from their mother. To make a baby, the father must put his sperm into the mother's body. This is called <i>having sex</i>. The man puts his <i>penis</i> into the woman's <i>vagina</i> and the sperm cells swim into the mother's body.
</p><p>Fertilization happens in the mother. The new zygote grows into a ball called a <i>morula</i> which will stick to the mother's <b>womb</b>. This ball grows into a <i>blastula</i> which later develops into a baby.
</p><p>Nine months after fertilization, a new baby will come out of the mother's vagina in a process called <b>childbirth</b>.
