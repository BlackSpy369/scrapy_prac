<p>The <b>respiratory system</b> is how air gets into our bodies. We breathe in and out with our <b>lungs</b>. The air we breathe in has something called <i>oxygen</i> that our cells need to work. The cells take in the oxygen and make an element called <i>carbon dioxide</i>, which we then breathe out.
</p><p>The respiratory system works together with the <a href="/wiki/Wikijunior:Biology/Systems/Circulatory_System" title="Wikijunior:Biology/Systems/Circulatory System">circulatory system</a> to make sure that oxygen gets to each cell of the body.
</p><p>Some parts of the respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Here is how they all work together:
